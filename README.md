# Object Detection Application

## Overview
The **Object Detection Application** is a web-based tool that uses computer vision to detect and identify objects in uploaded images. The application highlights detected objects with bounding boxes and labels, along with confidence scores. It utilizes the **facebook/detr-resnet-50** model for object detection and is powered by the Hugging Face `transformers` library.

## Features
- **Object Detection:** Detects objects in an uploaded image with high accuracy.
- **Bounding Boxes:** Draws red bounding boxes around detected objects.
- **Labels and Confidence Scores:** Displays the name of the object and the confidence score directly on the image.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Built using Gradio, making it intuitive and easy to use.

## How It Works
1. **Upload an Image:** Users upload an image from their device.
2. **Detect Objects:** The application processes the image using the `facebook/detr-resnet-50` model to detect objects.
3. **Visualize Results:** The processed image is returned with bounding boxes, object labels, and confidence scores.

Usage
Upload an Image:

Click on the "Upload Image" button and choose an image from your device.
View Results:

The application will display the image with bounding boxes and labels for detected objects.
Supported Image Formats:

The application supports common image formats like JPEG, PNG, and BMP.
# Example
Input:
Upload an image of a street scene with vehicles and pedestrians.

Output:
The processed image will show:

Red bounding boxes around cars, bikes, pedestrians, etc.
Labels like "Car" or "Person" with confidence scores (e.g., 0.95).
